Requirements:
 - A hardware audio dongle to read the cards, such as those provided by Square
   for their payment service.
 - Qt 4.6 or later (including Qt Multimedia plugin)

It has been confirmed to run on Linux, Windows and OS X.

To build on the terminal, simply run:

You may also open the project file in Qt Creator to build.
